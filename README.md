# DWM Dotfiles made for ThinkPad x220

This is not fully suckless build, it uses:
* dwm - window manager
* slstatus - status (batter, time, etc.) *<< Will be changed in future (something like dwmblocks)*
* kitty - terminal emulator
* i3lock - lockscreen
* mpv - media player
* picom - fancy graphics :)
* feh - wallpaper
